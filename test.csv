Jacob Birmingham,1,Lasted maybe a month,22/02/2024,10ft - Black,"I’ve had a lot of luck with other anker products, but not their 10’ c-c cable. Very flimsy. Had about a week out of the box before it became flimsy, then once flimsy it had to be plugged in at a certain angle in order to charge anything for about 2-3 weeks. Doesn’t charge anything now. Hopefully just a 1 off, but doubtful given the cable encountered minimal wear and tear throughout the duration of its life cycle.",1
Sam,1,Nylon thread comes apart after a few months,05/12/2022,10ft - Black,"Update 12/2023 lowered to 1 star:I bought this cable originally one year ago. After 5 months of use the Nylon Brading threads started to come loose right under the plastic ""plug"" and eventually could see the wires. Bought a new cable in August. Now 4 months later this cable is doing the same thing.It says it withstands over 12,000 bends. That is simply not true. After 8 months of use on the first purchase, and the 5 months after the 2nd purchase, both have had the same problem. Poor manufacturer and can't get a warranty replacement.--------Update: after about 10 days the manufacturing smell is finally gone from this Anker New Nylon 10ft USB C cable, so I was able to use it with the Samsung 50W charger next to my bed. Overall the build quality seems good and my Note 10+ recognizes the Fast Charge 2.0. Overall my main issue was the initial toxic smell from the cable when you take it out of the box, and took about 10 days to dissipate.--------Original review:I have used different Anker cables for years, but this New Nylon 10ft cable is the first one that I've used that has a strong toxic smell right of of the box. I couldn't use it to charge the phone next to my bed due to this toxic smell. I put the cable in another room and even outside and days later it still has this bad smell. I guess it's from whatever material is used during manufacturing. But after a week, I decided to return it and get a different Anker cable which is more like a rubber/silicone cover, but has no bad smell to it.",1
Neofocal,1,Not a 5A/100W cable. Voltage drop and cable resistance are greater than allowed by specification.,26/11/2023,3ft+6ft+10ft - Black,"Section 4.4.1 of the USB-C Cable and Connector Specification states that the maximum permissible IR voltage drop on Vbus and GND shall not exceed 500 mV and 250 mV, respectively. At 5A drawn on Vbus, this implies that the total cable resistance of Vbus and GND must not exceed 150 milliohms.The measured cable resistance of Vbus and GND for the 10ft cable is approximately 200 milliohms, which would be fine for a 3A cable, but not 5A.The measured cable resistance of Vbus and GND for the 6ft cable is approximately 190 milliohms, which would be fine for a 3A cable, but not 5A.The measured cable resistance of Vbus and GND for the 3.3ft cable is approximately 185 milliohms, which would be fine for a 3A cable, but not 5A.Very disappointed in Anker, these appear to be 3A cables with e-mark chips installed.",1
Notned,1,"Was a very good cable, when it worked",16/12/2023,10ft - Black,"I own several Anker products, all of which I have had no issues with. This cable, however, only lasted me about 4 months.The problem I get with my cable is this intermittent charge. Whenever I use the cable to charge my Pixel 6 it charges for a second or two and stops, repeating this for as long as the cable is plugged in; my phone screen turns off and on due to it being in a state of charging and not charging.I know it is the cable because when I use other USB C cables with the same charger and phone, they work fine.",1
BK,1,From 5 stars to 1 star,12/09/2023,3ft+6ft+10ft - Black,"Originally, didn't use it for much fast charging nor heavy load.But recently tested it with Samsung S23 Ultra, then the problem just show up right away.With Anker's own Prime Serie charger or Nano II, both show the same issue.The issue will stop and reconnect the phone almost every 1% charged or every 1 min or so.Therefore it won't stay connect.I have a review updated for the charger.  Prime 67W, originally I blamed the charger for it, because I tested with all 3 cables from this, and expect correct result. Man I am wrong.Once I used another brand 100W cable, issue solved with the charging issue. So this Anker cable seems not supporting the power or such? No idea, we will leave  it to Anker to explain to us.Now this cable is useless because it can't stay charge to my phone.",0
Stephen L.,1,Terrible quality,27/10/2023,10ft - Black,"I bought Anker because I read it was supposed to be the best.  My wife and I went through four of these (shame on us for being dumb enough to keeping buying them) but each failed after only a few months of use.  I've never had a charge cable and cube be this big of a pain in the neck. They either connect disconnect on their own like the connection is loose, or they flat out don't charge.  What a waste. I'll never buy another Anker product again.",1
W. Kitchens,1,Died in 2 months,23/12/2023,10ft - Silver,"Super disappointing to pay a premium for the Anker brand, only to have the cable die in less than 2 months. Not charging my iPhone 15 Pro anymore (other cables work fine).  Cable was just on my bedside stand the entire time, so it wasn’t even subject to any rough use.  Not buying Anker products again—their quality has clearly declined and it is no longer worth paying their inflated prices.",1
Ryan,1,Stopped working after less than a year.,17/11/2023,10ft - Black,"I bought this cable along with two random lesser known brands. I expected the Anker to outlast the other two cables, but it started having issues after about 6 months and completely stopped working after 10 months. The other two are still going strong.I should also note that this cable was never bent or tightly wound.Really disappointed that this didn't last longer.",1
Edwin Davy,1,My cable only passes 5W of power,21/06/2023,10ft - Black,Bought this cable to charge my Asus Ally via a battery pack. Paired it with the Anker 737 as I wanted 100W of power in order to run the Ally through a dock at max power. I then bought the Anker GaNPrime wall adapter that outputs 120W of power. When I use this cable into the power block to charge it from the wall adapter I only get 5W however when I use the cable that came with the 737 power bank I get 92W. Through this deduction I can confidently say that either A. I got a defective cable or B. This cable is not rated for what is being advertised. Returning and buying a different cable.,1
Tom,1,Inconsistent charging of macbook pro 16in 100w,15/09/2023,10ft - Black,This wire started having issues with consistently delivering a charge to my 16in macbook pro 100w after about a year. It will charge for like 5 seconds and then stop charging and then charge again and then stop charging. I'd have to play with the cable for like 2-3 minutes every time I plug it in before it will maintain a consistent charge. First Anker product that has been such a disappointment.,1
Paul Burkholder,1,No video transfer,12/01/2024,10ft - Silver,"I bought this item to power and send data to an external monitor I needed a distance away from my computer. When plugged in, it did not send data to external monitor. Worked fine with charging devices, just not to power my screen",1
Alejandro Ortega,1,Terrible,15/01/2024,10ft - Black,After a couple weeks it just stop working. I can't use it to charge anything. No matter how  many times I try to charge my phone or anything that requires type c charger it doesn't work. It's just simply bad product.,1
Josh H.,1,Won't charge my phone.,04/03/2024,10ft - Silver,"Causes issues with pixel6a, no other cable does. charging keeps turning on and off, i imagine must be some gap in the implementation of the PD spec.",1
Karen,1,Terrible musty odor!,12/10/2022,10ft - Black,I have several of this cable and they have performed great! With the discounted price on Prime preview days I ordered another. I have many Anker products and never an issue to date. This one smells of a strong terrible musty odor. I will wait 24 hours to see if the odor dissipates and if not this will be going back! It appears to me that Anker may have changed the exterior of this cable at some point which may contribute to the odor. Whatever the case it’s intolerable at this moment.Update: the odor hasn’t dissipated at all - in fact the area of the house I placed it to air out now also smells terrible when I opened the door! It’s getting returned. I would caution anyone that is sensitive/allergic to avoid this product! Clearly cutting corners on quality which raises red flags for their other products going forward.,1
AA,1,Does NOT work with Raspberry Pi or other PD devices,26/11/2023,6ft*5Pack - Black,I am so disappointed and past the 30 days return policy on this one. The cable is OK for phone charging but will not work with systems requiring power delivery....like Raspberry Pi 4. Have tested with different power supply and cables and this is definitely a case a of you get what you pay for.,1
Amazon Customer,1,I thought it was a good purchase until I saw my order history...,07/09/2023,10ft - Silver,"It's 2023 Sept, it has been having trouble charging for a while now and today it finally stopped working. I looked up my order history about to purchase Anker's again, and realized I placed orders around August for this thing 2 years straight! This means this charger breaks every year exactly around August/September forcing me to buy a new one. Not happy about that.",1
Jorge,1,Cable stopped working after 2 months,23/11/2023,10ft - Black,This cable looks good and worked good until it didn't. Worked well for two months with light use. Always used with a laptop so no stress to the cable.  then just stopped working. Was used with an Anker power supply that was compatible with this cable. I'll avoid Anker I'm the future,1
amgoldst,1,"Product failed Right After 90 day Warranty, Anker Wouldn';t Replace",07/08/2023,10ft - Silver,"I have used Anker products for years - not anymore.  This charging cable failed after a couple months of standard, daily use, so I contacted Anker support and asked for a replacement.  They said no, claiming that the warranty was only 90 days (I guess I waited a couple weeks too long to contact them about the issue).  I will never buy Anker products again.",1
Kyle Marko,1,Hard to actually use lifetime warranty I specifically bought this for.,27/04/2023,10ft - Black,"I remember specifically buying this cable for its lifetime warranty Anker claims to provide for all these cables, however they require proof of purchase on their website, which I cannot easily find in my amazon orders since I ordered this roughly a year ago. It is showing up in my reviews for whatever reason though.Also yes, it unfortunately will begin to break like any other cable seems to these days, but to their credit, this one did last me longer than any od my previous ones.",1
Esther Wardle,1,NOT FAST CHARGING CABLE!,09/11/2022,10ft - Black,I usually love Anker products but I was very disappointed in this cable. I bought it to replace my UNI cable that I'd been using for years had started bending. I bought this because of the so called fast charge. I put it in a fast charge pd outlet and this cable did not fast charge anything I put it to. I even changed pd ports and tried another pd outlet and still way slow like a normal cable. NOT A PD FAST CHARGE CABLE. I contacted Anker and they wanted all kinds of information for a replacement. I ended up getting a refund and bought from a seller who carried the UNI brand cable which is super fast and a great long lasting cable!,1
cyee,1,"Is not working properly, it is making my phone overheat.",27/05/2023,10ft - Black,"Poor Quality cable, I think the cable inside the braided nylon is broken. If I hold the cable, my phone will start charging and if I let go it will stop. The cable is making my phone overheat because it keeps charging on and off. The Anker Cable is still looks brand new after 1 year. Lifetime warranty is trash! I have 2 anker cable with the same issue, one is the anker braided micro usb cable and this usb c 100wt cable.",1
Sarah,1,Lasted 2 weeks,10/03/2024,10ft - Black,Totally stopped working after 2 weeks. Not really worth the effort to return it.,1
brek,1,Didn't last a year,06/01/2024,10ft - Red,"Cable no longer reliably charges. Checked my order history and was surprised to see the ""name brand"" cable has the issue while my generic cables are still going strong",1
Tech Guru,1,Stopped Working in a weem,12/12/2023,10ft - Black,"Cable worked great for about 1 week then shorted out and stopped charging my S21 Ultra, so in the trash it goes. These are hit or miss and I wouldn't recommend these cables. Look somewhere else.",1
josh,1,Failure,20/02/2024,10ft - Black,Quit working 90% of the time before 30 days. Didn't even start using it until week 2.,1
fazcc73,1,Anker is not what it used to be - cable is low quality,20/06/2023,10ft - Silver,"As other reviews have expressed, cable sometimes goes in charge for 3 seconds, stop charging for another 3, then back to charging, etc. If you try fiddling with it, it eventually stabilizes. I bought this because in the past Anker was good quality, but I guess it is no more. Cable looks sturdy, yet it is already have internal failure, after only 6 months or so.",1
Treyvion LeDay,1,This cable was great for about a week and then after that it never maintained a connection.,03/02/2024,10ft - Black,This cable was great for about a week and then after that it never maintained a connection.,1
Asher,1,Poor quality/defective,14/11/2023,3ft+6ft+10ft - Black,I bought these ANKER brand type C to type C in a 3pk with 3 different lengths.  After just 2 months of normal use only the 1 3ft cord is still working. The other 2 just randomly stopped charging/functioning.,1
sarah,1,broke for no reason after ~15 minutes,03/05/2022,10ft - Silver,"This product completely stopped charging about 15 minutes into using it for the first time. I'm not sure if this was just a defective cord, or if they are all so short-lived, but it just completely stopped working. And nothing at all had even changed to trigger it??? My laptop & I were sitting still, minding our own business when the charging connection stopped. And y'all, not even my desperate attempts at twisting it into other angles made the connection start work again. Please, please save your money for something that will (a) charge your laptop, (b) bring you joy, or (c) all of the above.",1
Jamie,1,Charge disconnects constantly,11/09/2023,10ft - Silver,This cord worked fine for a couple months but it no longer continuously charges. It struggles to get my laptop beyond a 5% charge. I regret this purchase and wish I had just gone for a true Apple brand charger. At least then there would be some guarantee or warranty.,1
Mr. H,1,Hit or miss,16/02/2024,10ft - Black,"I bought two wires, one of them isn’t working correctly the other works fine.",1

Andre,1,Cable constantly connects and disconnects.,21/06/2023,10ft - Silver,"I'm one of the many negative reviewers that has issues with this cable. For months this cable has been driving me insane. It constantly connects and disconnects when charging my MacBook. It's seemingly random too. Sometimes I go days without an issue, but other times my laptop will lose power every five seconds.",1
Abhishek Bhatnagar,1,Didn't last a year,16/10/2023,10ft - Black,Cable worked great for 8 months and now it doesn't work. Issue now is that the cable constantly disconnects from the phone and doesn't happen with any other cable so I know it's not my charging port.,1
SpendaMatic,1,Kinky cable,31/03/2023,10ft - Black,This cable always gets little kinks or loops in it. I leave it on the floor when not in use and when you pick it up to use it and pull it out to it’s full length you get several little loops. You have to un-loop them carefully or else the cable gets a serious bend in it. It’s like a cheap vacuum cleaner cord.,1
Hà My,1,Does not charge,13/04/2023,10ft - Black,"This charger is not too good, it has the charge notifications but it definitely did not charge. My battery was at 10% then 2 hours later I checked the battery was still at 10. So I decided to use my computer to see if the battery would go up but nope it went down rapidly. Keep in mind. My outlet was all working and plugged in.",1
Charla,1,Not as described,04/09/2023,10ft - Black,"This is NOT a fast charge cable.  My iPad normally fully charges from 0-10% to 100% in one hour.  This cable only charged it from 35% to 77% in 1.5 hours, that’s about 40%. So I returned it.",1
Christopher T. Slaterbeck,1,Doesn’t transmit video,04/09/2023,10ft - Black,Doesn’t work with a dock to transmit video. Only transmits power. Didn’t try to use video until after I had thrown away the box so now I can’t return it. Waste of money as it didn’t fulfill my needs.,1
Chris,1,Failed after one year,06/06/2023,10ft - Black,"Something inside the cable is fraying, and my laptop rapidly goes back and forth between charging and not charging. There's no question in my mind that the cable is likely to damage my device. This happened after a year. Really disappointed in Anker—did not associate them with crap products until now.",1
Uri,1,Stopped working after ~2 months of regular use,24/09/2022,10ft - Black,"I bought two cables and one of the cables stopped working at the two month mark. I think the end doesn't withstand bending very well, even though it has the nicer nylon exterior. It could also be user error, as during the evening i let the cable rest upright on on chest while it plugged in.  I'm disappointed because I've never had this issue with previous Anker cables.",1
Cindy,1,Quit Working a week after the return date,05/10/2023,10ft - Black,I thought it wa great at first but it just suddenly quit working after about 5 weeks of use  The mysterious thing about it was it wasn't kinked or anything,1

Tatsman,1,Doesn't do 100 watts,14/07/2023,10ft - Black,Have had these cables for a while. Have a 747 charger from anker and these cables. Plugged it into both of my 555 power stations in the 100 watt charging port and the cable doesn't do 100 watts.,1
Delta,1,Dies quickly,27/08/2023,10ft - Black,Died after less than a year of use. Kept giving me a blinking charging status. Completely useless product. Would be better off with a cheap bit of raw copper wire.,1

Rfb420,1,Only lasted 4 months.,16/02/2023,10ft - Black,Loose connection after 4 months.Waste of money!After I left this review Anker contacted me by email and then sent me a replacement.

Kevin C.,1,Cord is loose in port after 5 months of gentle use,10/06/2022,10ft - Black,"I switch between wireless charging and corded charging, only using the cord when i need to use my phone and charge at the same time. My cord is spooled over a hook hanging beside bed to prevent damage. I bought this cord for my new pixel 6 i got this past Christmas, and the cord disconnects and reconnects constantly.

Jamey H. Owens,1,Typical Garbage,04/09/2022,10ft - Black,This cable is worthless. Less than a month before failure. USB-C cables in general seem to be utter garbage.

changen pan,1,Dead after 3 months,26/07/2022,10ft - Silver,Decent cable but doesn't last. Has similar or perhaps worse durability compared to apple oem. It might be better to have a harder/uglier strain relieve on the ends rather than have it look nice but break after a few months.,1

LH,2,Failed just after a year of use.,03/03/2024,10ft - Silver,"I've always trusted Anker, so I had no worries about ordering this rather than the Apple brand. Others have lasted as long as the devices connected to them. Not the case with this one. Got it as an alternative to the short cord that came with my MacBook Air. It arrived on Feb 9, 2023 and started failing a few days ago. I didn't know the cause of the ""beeps"" on my Mac until today, March 3, 2024, when it failed completely. I had it plugged in overnight so didn't pay much attention until I noticed the battery indicator change color. Of course, I was on deadline and ended up having to go get a cable at the nearest place, which will not be adequate for long-term use. Very frustrating and disappointing.

I purchased it in May 2022 and by the end of the year the cable started to have connection issues.  I wasn't sure if it was the charging block or the cord, but fter a few tries, I realized that it was the cable that was not working.

EmbeddedFlyer,2,"Has compatibility issues with multiple laptops, stiff, bulky, Anker FAIL",02/11/2022,10ft - Red,"Anker has, in the past, been among the best brands for cables and chargers but they seem to have lost their way. I have various laptops and other devices that charge with USB C and this cable only works with about half of them while Anker's earlier cables work with all of them. What's going on Anker??? You're going backwards.Even using this cable with 3 different Anker PD chargers, it refuses to charge one of my M1 Mackbooks, two of my Dell laptops, and my 12 inch M1 iPad Pro. Using a 2 year old Anker USB C cable with those same chargers and laptops works perfectly.And this cable is very thick, rather stiff, and just not very user friendly. It doesn't coil up well for storage and it doesn't like to lay flat when in use. The stiffness also puts extra stress on the USB C port of whatever device it's connected to. And the USB connector itself has rather high insertion force compared to most cables which also will likely stress the USB port on your device.The issue isn't how much current this cable can carry as, using a USB C power analyzer, it can deliver 60+ watts to devices it's compatible with. It appears the issue is how it's wired/configured as some devices just refuse to charge with it.Anker needs to do MUCH better. They're charging a premium price for a clearly inferior product.",1

This time around neither cord that I ordered fits in my phone without falling back out. I've checked with other chords and that is not a problem. For some reason with this brand the two that I ordered did not fit,1
C. Taylor,2,UPDATE: cable is failing,02/08/2023,10ft - Silver,"Apparently Apple thinks everyone has a plug within 5 feet of them at all times.. I'm so happy that Anker (a brand whose products I've come to trust) makes longer cables. The nylon cable is super sturdy and looks great. Love this cable!UPDATE 11/9/2023: for the last month or so, when I plug my computer in using this cable, it will initially connect, and then intermittently disconnect several times, sometimes once, sometimes 10 times. It happens in 3-5 second intervals. This is especially annoying if my computer is almost dead. My trust of Anker products so steadily declining. Another example: I got a phone charger cable that started to fray on one end after a few months use. I will be hesitant to buy more Anker products if this is where there quality is headed.",1
DP,2,Died in one year - Anker customer service has gone downhill,11/06/2023,10ft - Black,"All these kinds of products (chargers, usb c cables, battery packs) are all the same. Only the branding and superficial qualities (cable sheathing, colors) separates one from the other. I still went with Anker because they used to have the best customer service out there and stood behind their products.After this cable died on me after one year, I went through the warranty process to get a replacement. After jumping through multiple hoops, sending a bunch of pictures, reiterating the same information already provided etc, I destroyed the defective cable per instructions and waited for a replacement. When it came I opened it up to find they sent me an obviously damaged, used cable in a taped up box.I’ve just about had it with Anker. I paid the upcharge versus their competitors for the knowledge they had the customers back. No longer the case. I’ll save my money next time and just toss the cable when it inevitably dies.",1

Alternative cables work in same configuration. I trusted Anker, and they let me down. Note that this states USB 2.0. My research indicates I need USB3.1 for my devices.

Green Mario,2,Nope.,01/02/2023,10ft - Black,Probably the worst-quality thing I've ever bought with an Anker brand stamp on it. These cables didn't last 2 weeks before they started cutting in and out.

I don't have a car, and I'm not paying to Uber somewhere to return it or paying almost as than the charger was to return it. If you don't have a case or don't mind taking it off every time you use it, then it seems to work ok. Otherwise, DON'T get this one if you have any case on your phone. I can't talk about durability.

I enjoyed the cable until it started cutting in and out. The braided cable appears to be perfectly fine but the connection drops. I always roll the cable back up after using it for charging, perhaps it cannot be rolled and is therefore so durable, despite the braided cabling looking perfect? Disappointed it only lasted 6 months. The original Apple MacBook Air 2018 cable isn't braided, and it took 3.5 years before it started to have connection issues.

Ethan Schoonover,3,"Thinner than other 10ft, but that's an issue",10/08/2021,10ft - Black,"Full disclosure: almost every charging cable I buy is from Anker. I settled on them long ago and have almost never been disappointed. That said, this is the first Anker cable I've had where I feel it could really do with some improvements.I own a couple other 10ft usb-c cables I bought before Anker had released a 10ft c to c cable (Uni brand, not going to say you should or shouldn't get those instead since I don't know if they have maintained their quality over time, I bought those years ago). The Uni cables I own are pretty thick, woven cable sheath. Similar to this Anker cable but thicker.It turns out that in a 10ft cable, thicker is better if you are going to be putting it away in a bag. Coiling it up and uncoiling it repeatedly means a thick cable won't kink up easily and will lie flat when unrolled.This cable is long enough and thin enought that it unfortunately kinks up a bit. Not much! but even one kink when unrolling it is inconvenient and makes me concerned that over time this may result in some twisting or excessive wear of the cable interior.I don't love how thick the other usb-c cables (the non anker cables) I own are. They've always felt... excessive. But I appreciate that they are heavy enough to basically never kink up.YMMV, but let this be food for thought. Anker, if you are listening, I'd prefer to see these a bit thicker or less kink prone.",0

Most of them arrived great but the most recent one arrived with tempered box and super smelly cable that I've never seen before. Called Anker and it's NOT normal (maybe Amazon did the ""return as new"" thing again). They'll take care of it by offering me an exchange.Beside that, everything else is good.

I purchased this cable a year ago and it already has enough wear on it to where it's no longer charging properly, in fact some devices won't charge at all. The cable now has to be plugged in on specific sides instead of either side, which defeats the whole purpose of the USB-C's design and a certain end needs to be plugged into the phone and the cable itself has to be angled perfectly in order to charge. While I recommend this for the length I do not recommend it for heavy use, if you're willing to sacrifice length for durability I highly recommend Anker's powerline series of C cables as I've bought my powerline cable 2 years ago and it's still working perfectly.TL;DR This cable is not durable enough for heavy use, the Anker Powerline cables are.",1
Ray,3,"Very stiff cable, great customer service",12/02/2023,10ft - Black,"I did not expect the cable to be as stiff as it is. Unfortunately that characteristic makes it unsuitable for many applications.UPDATE:After posting the previous review, the company reached out to me and offered to refund my money. I declined because I found another use for the cable, but I am very impressed with their customer service.",1
Brandon Connett,3,Good Cable. Bad Twisting,06/05/2023,10ft - Black,This cable gets the job done. If you wrap or twist this cable it is harder than the typical cable to unwind,1
S. Taylor,3,Nice looking cable that works fine... But the smell!,12/02/2023,10ft - Black,"As others have mentioned, this cable really stinks with a moldy odor. Just got mine today and I'm 'airing it out', so the smell won't be so bad later (hopefully). Other than that, it looks and works fine, and comes with a velcro wrap.",1
Drew P.,3,Didn't last 6 months,14/10/2022,10ft - Black,"I use this cable for 1 location, my bed. It was actually 2x too large but that's my fault. So I bring up the location # to try to preface this as my cable wasn't bent that much in 6 months, but yet trying it now at a year old, my pixel 6 pro and pixel 7 pro both hate it, they alert me via vibrations that it's unconnecting and connecting constantly.Edit: Anker did honor warranty and replaced it, I'll change my rating as I found that good",1

CyberSensei🥋,4,⚡️ The Ultimate Charge: Anker's 100W Nylon USB-C Cable Unleashed 🌟🌟🌟🌟,09/03/2024,10ft - Silver,"In the fast-paced world of technology, staying powered up and ready to go is more than a convenience—it's a necessity. With devices becoming increasingly powerful and energy-hungry, the quest for the perfect charging solution becomes paramount. Enter the realm of high-wattage USB-C cables, a category where the Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C to USB-C 2.0 Cable shines brightly. This cable isn't just another accessory; it's a testament to Anker's commitment to quality, durability, and performance, designed to meet the needs of the most demanding gadgets in your arsenal.As someone who relies heavily on a range of devices for both work and play, finding a charging cable that can keep up with my lifestyle has been a journey filled with trials and errors. The Anker 100W cable, with its promise of fast charging and a robust build, caught my attention as a potential game-changer. From the MacBook Pro to the iPad Pro 2020, and even the Samsung Galaxy S20, this cable promised compatibility and performance across the board. My experience with it has been revealing, showcasing not just the strengths of Anker's design but also highlighting areas where even the best can improve.### Key Highlights:- **Robust Power Delivery**: This cable’s ability to deliver up to 100W of power is nothing short of impressive. It effortlessly charges my MacBook Pro 2020, keeping it powered through the longest of work sessions without breaking a sweat.- **Versatility at Its Core**: The compatibility list of the Anker cable reads like a who’s who of high-end gadgets. From the latest iPad Pro and Air models to top-tier Android devices, this cable has you covered, making it a versatile pick for a tech-savvy user.- 📏 **Extended Reach**: The 10ft length is a game-changer, offering the flexibility to charge devices comfortably, even when the nearest outlet is just out of reach. This extra length means I can use my gadgets in bed or on the sofa without being tethered too close to the wall.- **Durable Design**: Wrapped in a new nylon exterior, the cable not only looks premium but feels built to last. It’s managed to withstand the daily grind of bends and twists without showing signs of wear, a testament to its durability.### Areas for Improvement:- **Stiffness**: While the nylon wrapping adds to the cable’s durability, it also introduces a bit of stiffness. This can make it a tad unwieldy to coil up or manage, especially in tighter spaces or when on the move.- ⚙️ **Connector Size**: The USB-C connectors, while robust, are slightly on the larger side. This isn’t a deal-breaker, but it can be a snug fit in devices with closely spaced ports or when using certain cases.### Summary & Recommendation:The Anker 100W 10ft Nylon USB-C to USB-C Cable earns a well-deserved 4-star rating 🌟🌟🌟🌟. It marries power with versatility, all wrapped up in a durable and stylish design, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to streamline their charging setup. While it’s not without its quirks, such as the cable’s stiffness and the size of the connectors, these are minor gripes in the grand scheme of things.For tech enthusiasts juggling multiple devices or anyone in need of a reliable, high-powered charging solution, this Anker cable is a compelling choice. It’s a cable that not only meets the demands of today’s power-hungry devices but does so with flair and durability.Thank you for considering this review. Whether you're looking to charge your MacBook, iPad, or any USB-C enabled device, the Anker 100W cable is poised to be a powerful ally in your tech arsenal, making it easier to keep your devices powered and ready to go.",1

Anker makes good products, and this charging cable has been no exception. It doesn't seem to heat up or be finicky in any way, though I have yet to charge it at 100+ watts or any extreme load.My only 'gripe' is that the cable portion is a bit 'stiff' and the end connector is 'notchy' during insertion, but both will probably 'wear in' rapidly.Like most of the rest of their products, this cable is highly recommended.",1
Ritu Niyogi,4,Great quality,23/08/2023,10ft - Silver,Love the high quality braided nylon cable. I just started using it last week. But so far so good and hope that Anker lives up to it’s name 🙌🏼,1

John,4,"Great cable, but it smells so bad I don’t want to put it in my bag.",03/01/2023,10ft - Black,"I don’t know if this is the Amazon warehouse’s failing or somewhere in the Anker supply chain, but the cable smells so strongly of mildew—think like your grandmother’s wet basement—that I don’t want to put it in my bag and have the canvas and liner of the briefcase take on that smell. It’s positively revolting. I’ve sprayed (read, “drenched”) it with Ozium which is a very powerful sanitizer and am letting it air out, but this is the second Anker product I’ve purchased recently with this issue. (Note: I’ve purchased a LOT of Anker products though; they’re my go-to for power and cabling.)Figure this out, Anker/Amazon, because this is absolutely disgusting. It also makes me wonder if the connectors or chips inside of the connectors have taken on water at some point.",1

Engineer IndyJoe,4,Provides same performance as the OEM charger,12/05/2023,10ft - Black,Using this cable with a 100w charger I measured an equivalent wattage transferred to a new Lenovo laptop. Cable quality is decent although I’d prefer a vinyl or silicone sheath to a braided one.,1
Amazon Customer,4,This cable is great value for money,22/11/2022,10ft - Black,I received this cable and I was immediately impressed with the quality . The braided cable was done well and seems like it will last some time. It does support the 100w charging as long as you have a 100w compatible charging dock. I use an iPad Pro m1 12.9 and it was able to completely charge from 8% to 100% in a little over an hour with me using it. Highly recommend. My review is based on first impressions and my experience with product after one week.,1
Access Denied,4,The design quality and function of the cable is fine but.....,30/12/2022,10ft - Black,The only reason I didn't give five stars across the board is because when I unwrap this it had obviously been sitting in a warehouse with less than optimal temperature control because it has a really strong smell of black mold it works fine but you guys better put a heater in the storage that these things sit in and some atmosphere drying bags because this is really hard to clean I had to use a sanitary wipe multiple passes to get it to smell moderately good.,1

Unsure if the lower than rated performance is normal, but it’s odd that middle length cable seems worse than the rest. Maybe the quality varies from batch to batch. 🤔",1

Paul W. Jones,4,"Good sturdy cable, if a bit pricey and slow",27/04/2022,10ft - Black,"Anker products are generally very good quality, sometimes having better strain relief and consequently higher duty cycle than standard Apple cables (which can also be pretty pricey).  In a way, it is a get what you pay for sort of proposition.  The 10 foot version of this cable only supports USB 2.  I use this on a spare USB-C charger (also from Anker) on an iPad Pro (2021), works fine.  The main thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that it is not USB 3 or 4.  The 100W rating is a definite plus, though overkill for an iPad.",1

When I use either device plugged in, the cable is long and flexible and I don't worry about it as much as those tiny white Apple ones that start bulging at the connector in a couple of months if you'd don't treat them with the proper respect.

Marcie,5,Anker a great reliable product I have used for years in various formats.,29/01/2024,10ft - Black,"The 10’ length is great when you need the extra cable so as not to pull or stretch in awkward areas where the extra length is necessary. The main reason for the this purchase is my new phone which has a “C” connector vs my previous which was lighting connection.  I also purchased other Anker cables in various connector formats due to my upgrade including “A” to “C” cables for power packs, etc. This purchase was also 25% off for a quality braided cable with no charging issues. It was great to find the little velcro tie included which helps to manage the length of cable when necessary.",0
Michelle,5,Relaible Anker,09/12/2023,10ft - Red,"Anker has always been my go-to brand for chargers, cables, and power adapters. They are reliable, high-quality, and well worth the money. This experience was no different than my others.The braded cable is sturdy and thick, as a 10-ft cable should be. To my surprise, Anker included a little velcro cable tie in the box. I was pretty excited to see that since cable management can become a pain with longer ones. I worry rolling and weaving a cable around itself may cause damage over time, so this alleviated the concern a bit. Unfortunately, it did not last very long. I imagine it wore down a bit faster due to my handling and the braded material of the cable itself. It was still an extra touch not seen from other companies.It works very well and I have had no issues with it. I was a little annoyed how every small electronic seems to be transitioning to USB-C, but at least Anker is around to provide the cables I need.",1
rick hancock,5,Great cord,11/03/2024,10ft - Red,This cord is made well and gives me the ability to charge my phone while sitting somewhere that is a decent distance away from the wall.,1
Ryan Hoffman,5,"Lasted 18 months of heavy use, great value!",20/02/2024,10ft - Black,"The cable (purchased 8/22) lasted about 18 months. I’m rough on my cables, so it was fully expected to wear out eventually. For the price, I consider this a great value!Ultimately failed near one of the plugs, becoming very sensitive to orientation/pressure and intermittently disconnecting. This end of the cable got yanked on a lot in my setup (including awkwardly perpendicular to the plug) - if you’re more careful with yours, it could probably last much longer!",1
chris,5,Great product by anker and I use it for everything,12/03/2024,10ft - Silver,"Great cable. I mainly use this for my PC charger to another Anker 100W charger. I also sometimes use this for my ipad/iphone or other usb-c device. It charges everything and is a very multiversatile cable. You can get them in different lengths, but the 10ft one is good for laptop. If you get a Anker charger and use this cable it saves so much space compared to the laptop chargers that are huge and bricky.",1
bigcountrybaloo,5,Anker cables are always solid,04/03/2024,10ft - Black,"Anker cables are always my first choice when looking for a new cable to meet my needs. I bought this USB C to USB C 10’ cable to allow for charging my computer while working on schoolwork and to allow the cable to lay flat along the ground from the plug, and my 6’ cable didn’t accomplish that. It now lives in my school bag with my Anker GAN charger, so I or any of my classmates won’t be caught short.",1

It’s also great when traveling by car because it reaches the kids in the back with length to spare.",1
McKool,5,"Anker USB C to C, 2.0 - Exceptional!",03/03/2024,10ft - Red,"I purposely purchased this brand and length for the Master Bedroom, where my wife has her iPhone and iPad.  Anker is well known for exceptional quality, and this cable is a testament to that.  The extra length was needed to snake from the outlet, up and around the bed, to give her the length to charge her electronics.  Ahhh... Apple charging harmony!",1
Vinay K,5,Great companion to the 120W charger,22/02/2024,10ft - Black,The advertised 65W PD charger of a power adapter didn't work on a recent flight to charge my MacBook. This cable along with the 120W Anker charger power adapter ( plugged into the power adapter portion of the above adapter ) pulled enough watts to charge my MacBook. A cable like this is needed along with the Anker charger. Don't buy the cheap no name ones.,1
Ed C,5,Well made,12/03/2024,6ft*3Pack - Black,"I used one on my phone, it didn't work. Found out it was an issue with my phone. I'm going have it looked at in the near future.",1
Dunewolf,5,Works as advertised,03/01/2024,10ft - Black,I was using some other cables prior to this and noticed the slow charge rates.. At the time I did not suspect the cable being the reason for longer charge times / slow charging rate.. but after some testing with shorter cables and some reading into how cable thickness and length plays a role in charging rates (ie speed) - I decided to order a long cable marked for higher power rating / speed - well cable has lived up to its status.I still have the length needed to go from charger to my device while getting quick recharge times and even enough power to keep the device on while watching full length videos and still have power to charge battery.  so if you need a longer range from your plug in charger - getting a cable built for the power/length is important. so getting this will help your charging speeds be higher while not having to sit so close to plug.,1
P. Dugas,5,Excellent Anker Quality product,22/02/2024,10ft - Black,"I have been using Anker products for decades because they seem to make quality products that do what they are supposed to do.  I use these cable with a 20Watt apple adapter for iPhones, iPads, spotlights, laptops, and every other electrical and electronic product that needs to be charged.  I have never had issues with Anker.",1
mark,5,Works great for charging and not to bad for file transfer,26/11/2023,10ft - Silver,"It's nice having a 10ft cable that's capable of 100 watts of power delivery, but it's only a USB 2.0 data transfer cable so your limited to about 480mbps data transfer speed. But for a durable cable that feels like it's good quality for about $10 your not going to get it all! Most of us these days need the higher power capability of a cable these days anyway. And if you need to transfer some files 480mbps isn't all that bad.  That's 40MBps or 1GB in about 15 seconds. Which isn't bad for work files or some pictures. Now if your trying to transfer your entire phone contents that's 256GB like my galaxy S22 ultra then your going to go crazy waiting. But in that scenario your not trying to charge and your going to want a cable that can move data at the USB 3.2 rated speeds the phone is capable of, which would be a short 3ft long Thunder Bolt cable. To get fast transfer speeds the cable needs to be short and all your going to get from any computers USB port is 10 watts so all the wires needed to carry power are used for data which is fine because 10 watts is all a computer USB is going to give you anyway. So it really comes down to what you need.. data transfer get a thunderbolt cable and leave it plugged in to your PC, power delivery get a high wattage cable. Which USB 2.0 speeds are fine because it's only talking to the charger...",1

Here's the lowdown on why it's pretty cool:First off, it has this neat right-angle design. This means it sticks out to the side instead of straight out, so it's more comfy to use your phone while it's charging. No more awkward holding or bending the cable in weird ways.It charges your phone super fast, too. We all know how annoying it is to wait forever for your phone to charge. With this charger, you'll be back to using your phone in no time. It's like going from a slow old car to a speedy race car.The cable itself is really strong. You know how some chargers fall apart after you've used them a bit? This one doesn't do that. It's made to last, so you won't have to keep buying new ones.Plus, it's super long—over 6 feet! You can easily use your phone from the couch or bed without feeling stuck to the wall. It gives you freedom to move around while staying plugged in.So, if you're looking for a charger that's easy to use, quick to charge, tough, and long enough to give you space to relax, the Ainope USB-C Right Angle Charger is a great pick.

The cord is very sturdy and charges very fast.  I selected this one because of the charger is already angled sideways and this helps eliminate wearing out the cord.  It has worked very good.  I bought the two pack so that I could have one at home and on the go.  Would definitely purchase again.,1

I'm so glad I didn't buy extras, because honestly I don't need any now.  These cords are still like new!  At this rate I expect them to last forever!  These are not like the regular plastic cords you used to get with most devices.  They are heavy duty rough and tuff.  Works with my chargers to help not overcharge my tablets and phone.  The ""right angle"" is a game changer.  Works with my Motorola turbo charger, and everything that is USB to type C.  Fast Charging.",1
b. bailey,4,"I use one cable as a dedicated home charger and so far, so good",20/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,"It seems durable and like it would be durable for travel, as well. The only thing I don't like is that the USB C-connector is at a right angle to the cable instead of inline. This is the first charging cable I've owned that does and it takes some getting used to. It doesn't charge as fast as my OEM cable did but it does charge steadily/consistently, which I appreciate since I mostly charge overnight. I'd buy this again if I could find a version that didn't have the angled C-connector (I find it extremely counterintuitive) ... and/or a version with two USB C-connectors.

I needed something better that worked...all the time.  This cable does just that...it works all the time.  Maybe it is designed for ""fast charging"" where my other cables were not.  However, the bottom line is this is a great cable.I always had problems with straight in charging cables.  It could be that twisting and turning the cable might have damaged it.  However this cable is not a ""straight in"" cable. it has a right angle. Also, the connection appears to be very well built an durable.I highly recommend this cable.

I was just looking for a basic usb C for my android.. These guys popped up and I had NO idea this new configuration even existed.. What a genius Idea!Initially I ordered a set of 2 but I thought I had ordered USB to USB-C but I had ordered USB-C to USB-CI immediately initiated a return and ordered the correct ones that I needed.. I was very impressed with the ease of return, quick refund and when the new ones arrived I was impressed with the attention to detail in the cords from packaging, to the great little Velcro wrap that comes attached to the cord, to the Quality!It feels super SOLID and I feel it will hold up better due to the sideways design.  It also helps with the holder that I have in my car and the cord tucks neatly against the phone and down to the outlet. The old cords just stuck straight out and the way my car is that would interfere with the view of my display and back up camera.. Now I don't have to worry about that with this great new configuration.My hope is that it has a nice life span and holds up.. So far it's a winner!My only regret? I didn't see any cords for Apple Products.. I would LOVE this for my iPad. Hopefully that will come in the future.. Hat's off the great ingenuity.. HUGE improvement over the standard cords we are all used to..",1
Melessa Church,5,Great angled charger cord for S23fe,12/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - PurpleNumber of Items: 2,"I have always hated how typical chargers got ruined from the cord wires inside getting worn out from being bent so I researched top charging cords with an angled plug in and this brand came up repeatedly as one of the top safe angled charger cords.I ordered this one for my new S23fe Android phone and chose the purple cord, set of 2 in the 6.6ft size.Cords arrived quickly, faster than expected and I immediately plugged it into my phone.The angled cord fit great and snug into my S23fe phone, even with a significantly thick phone case.It is so much nicer to not have my cord end being bent during use. It's also made charging while using so much easier!The cord has velcro straps to nicely wrap up any excess cord, if needed. I find that very useful for my needs.It charges much faster than the 1 foot cord that came with the phone, so I'm quite pleased. The purple color matches my phone case as if they were made at the same time!5 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ across the board for this charging cord with angled plug in on the end.",1

I have ordered these in the middle of 2021 and I still have had zero issues with them. Would definitely recommend for the money I will never buy another charger. I have one at work and one at home. Home I constantly am charging a phone, speaker, earbuds or headphone and at work I am constantly charging phones, tablets, special diagnostic equipment and also earbuds. 150% recommend these cables. Would give 10 stars if it was a option.",1
Thomas R. Slak,5,Good value,03/03/2024,3.3FT+3.3FT - BlueNumber of Items: 2,I bought these so I could have one at home and one in my car.  The right angle USB-C plug will work great in the phone holsters I bought that DON'T have an access slot in the bottom of the holster for a charge cord. Simple cure is the put phone in the holster upside down and use these cables that fit perfectly under the flap.,1

The charge cords I had before would bend and I couldn't rest my phone or arms down and always had to hold it up, making my shoulders and arms hurt.

MRH57,5,Great design,11/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,"When using a standard straight USB-C charging port on my phone, if I was lounging in bed, the cable would start to fail after a month or two since the cord would bend in the direction of the wall outlet.  This design solves that problem since the plug can be inserted into a USB-C charging port with the cable directed in the direction of the outlet. It is a fantastic solution to a common problem that I have experienced with multiple brands of charging cables.",1

I mean my phones and my devices trying to really fast. I love the lymph on them. Yeah so I will recommend these to anybody.

Lego Buyer,4,Might not work with ALL phone cases.,19/02/2024,10FT+10FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,"The point of a right angle is to take the pressure of the cord from cases with closing ports.  This one does fit my phone with it's case on, but barely.Right angle cords need to make their ports a tad longer.  Other than this, it is great at fast charging my phone at a really great price.  You get 2 cords for around the same price as 1.",1

Great for on vacation or even at home.  They are much better than the straight ones.  Don't ravel or break at the end of the phone  which has happened to everyone of my straight cords.  I've had one of these side recharger for a couple of years now and it hasn't come apart yet!,1

These work great- charge fast and have a long/flexible cord! We love the 90 degree angled connection, this is great because that is normally where our cords break.  Both ends plug in nicely and stay connected.  As an added bonus I like the Velcro strap to help store this charging cord when not in use!",0

Abby Valdovinos,5,Longer lifespan,12/01/2024,3.3FT+3.3FT - BlueNumber of Items: 2,The cable has a nice and durable feel to it. It has the rubber support around the areas that tend to get worn out and split which is a huge pro. Another thing that I really like about this cable is that the actual phone plug is at a right angle. I prefer these much more that the straight style because you constantly have to bend those which causes unnecessary wear on the cable. The right angle and rubber bumper will make this cable last much longer than your average cable would.,1

Phil,5,Sturdy and good fit,20/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,I really like these! I like to way that they fit in from the side! They are much more durable than the ones that go straight in. They don't get damaged easily like the others!,1
Mina Rose,4,Works well,26/02/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,"It takes some getting used to, due to the little side thingy but it works well.",1
Melissa A.,5,My favorite!,10/01/2024,6.6FT+6.6FT - GreyNumber of Items: 2,"I have gone through sooo many cords because the connection to my phone inevitably fails since i hit the connection so much when i'm using my phone while it's charging. This cord's connection is very sturdy and, because it connects to my phone at a 90 degree angle, it doesn't get in the way when i'm using it while it's charging. It also charges very fast. I have a feeling it will last a long time. If i don't update, then it is still performing splendidly!",1
